# radian-net-proxy-pipe

`radian-net-proxy-pipe` is a focused TypeScript codebase around design a TypeScript verification harness for proxy systems, covering protocol validation, framed sample traffic, and failure-oriented tests. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Radian Net Proxy Pipe Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the networking idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## Capabilities

- Includes extended examples for retry behavior, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents policy decisions tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Reason For The Project

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Where Things Live

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `package.json`: Node package scripts

## How It Is Put Together

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying networking behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The TypeScript project keeps types close to the model and compiles before running its checks.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Data Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Tradeoffs

The repository favors determinism over breadth. It does not pull live data, keep secrets, or depend on network access for verification.

## Possible Extensions

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more networking fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Getting It Running

Use a normal shell with TypeScript available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.
